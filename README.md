## SkillDisplay
A simple no-frills ACTWebSocket overlay for showing skills, designed as a Proof-of-Concept.

## Installation
Make sure the 'Using BeforeLogLineRead' box is checked in ACTWebSocket then click the 'Add URL' button to add this URL:
`https://rawrington.github.io/SkillDisplay/`

## Troubleshooting
I have only tested and confirmed this working on the QT5.8.0 variant of OverlayProc with ACTWebSocket 1.3.3.9 so if you are having trouble please use these versions.
